# Space Castle
Space Castle is a retro style platform adventure game with a mystery storyline that is similar in playability to the games Metroid by Nintendo and Cave story by Doukutsu Monogatari.

Bosses try to hamper the player from learning the true nature of the doctor. Most Malas believe that the doctor is the only one that can cure them before they turn into a monster like one Mala did. Are the Malas telling the truth?

This game has an ending but will continue to be programmed. Plans are to have a mini map system, more maps to create, more puzzles, more tile graphics, increased monster difficulty based on weapon used, etc.
