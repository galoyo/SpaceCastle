Susan is hiding from the docter. She is at the other side of this door.#She looks very unhealthy.. We do not understand why she is running away and hidding. Most Malas believe she was lucky that the docter picked her first for treatment. Try to convince her to see the docter before the docter picks another Mala.#@
